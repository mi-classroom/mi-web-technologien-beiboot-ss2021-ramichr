# ADR-02 - Client choice

## Status

Implemented

## Context

Client for fetching data from the Server with simple data structure navigation and form for writing new image-data.

### Options

- React
- Vue.js
- Angular

## Decision

Use Vue.js.

## Consequences

- Easier to use and learn.
- Both client and server are built in the same language, which presumably reduces the effort.
